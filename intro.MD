# Resampling Statistics

### Notes and code to go along with *Resampling: The New Statistics* (1974) by Julian L. Simon

> An introduction to statistics, python and R using words you know to explain things you don't

This 1974 book that was reprinted a bunch of times since, primarily because it's dank, is one of the better
introductions to statistical thinking. *Statistical thinking* meaning how we can comprehend information
in a numerical way.
The type of statistics this book introduces is referred to as Non-parametric Statistics which is a fancy term
we can unpack. Non-parametric means that we aren't making assumptions about the thing that created the numbers and
statistics means to use the numbers available to tell us things that we are interested in.

These notebooks, which are written in both python and R programming languages, take the examples that are given
in *Resampling* to explain concepts in probability and statistics by parsing them into modern programming languages
ready for you to explore and then take to do cool stuff with numbers in the real world to like impress people and stuff.
If you don't have any previous programming experience stay away! JK, the idea is we are going to introduce stuff as we
go through these examples and concepts that are given in a book. As a statistician unlike the mythical creature
The Data Scientist, people won't expect you to know every in and out of the programming language you work in,
so you just need to know how to get it done, not necessarily in the prettiest way. This book will try to give you
an understanding of the basic tools and how to use them in human speak, but will absolutely not debate best practices
in jargony words because if that is what you want you can search tl;dr posts on Stack Overflow. Here we will introduce
the thing, its name and why tf we'd even botther mentioning it.
