    "We can see that we end up with 2/3 as we expected however I acknowledge this code is a little opaque. The tricky part of it is that we have 3 arrays and we need to draw a random element from that little array then take the other element. So my solution to this problem was to use a array of random numbers selected from {0,1,2} here I used 100 to work as my \"ship finder\" then I had to use `np.random.choice` on the selection from my ship finder. However there wasn't a good way to do this vectorized so I just put it into a list comprehension and converted that list back to an array. From here I deleted all the rows of the matrix where the first column was equal to 1 (where we found silver first). Then I only had a matrix where the first element was 0 so I just needed to count the rows where the second element was also 0 and divide that by the total remaining rows\n",
